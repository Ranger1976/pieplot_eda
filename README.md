# pieplot_eda
Generate pie plots to show energy values from LMOEDA analysis 

LMOEDA analysis (Su2009, Su2012, Su2014, Su2020) is used to decompose interaction energies between molecules, and is implemented in the quantum chemistry package GAMESS-US, https://www.msg.chem.iastate.edu/gamess/

The analysis yields interaction energy values. This python scripts plots these interaction energies as a pie chart.

Requirements: python3 and the following packages: argparse, re, matplotlib
To install these:
>pip3 install argparse, re, matplotlib

To run the script:
>python3 pieplot_eda.py (arguments)
